## My process

### Built with

- Plain old HTML
- Plain old CSS

### What I learned

- Box-shadow is an easy way to make your site look cool
- You should think about the HTML required for all your site layouts before coding the first layout. Adding a div for the middle two cards in the desktop layout worked in this case, but better planning would have saved potential rework had that failed.
